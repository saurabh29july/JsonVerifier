JsonVerifier
============

Similar to JSONLint this project lets you validate json's with comments also.

If you are using JSON for configuration files, then you might have to comment/uncomment a few things. After commenting the attributes, JSONLint did not work for me hence I created this project.

This project is hosted at http://absolutejsonverifier.appspot.com/
